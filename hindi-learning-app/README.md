## Running Locally (No Server Required)

### For End Users

1. **Build the application** (if not already built):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Navigate to the dist folder**:
   - The build process creates a `dist` folder with all necessary files

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19.2.0 (functional components with hooks)
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.2.4 (fast development and optimized builds)
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest 4.0.15 (unit and property-based testing)
- **Testing Libraries**: 
  - @testing-library/react (component testing)
  - @testing-library/user-event (interaction simulation)
  - @testing-library/jest-dom (DOM matchers)
  - fast-check (property-based testing)

### Configuration

- **Vite Config**: Configured with relative paths (`base: './'`) for local file system usage
- **Vitest Config**: Configured with jsdom environment and global test utilities
- **Test Setup**: Automatic cleanup after each test with @testing-library/react
- **Build Output**: Optimized static files with all assets bundled

### Key Features

- **No Server Required**: All assets are bundled locally with relative paths
- **Offline First**: No network requests during normal operation
- **Audio Caching**: Audio files are cached after first play for better performance
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes
- **Child-Friendly UI**: Large buttons, bright colors, smooth animations

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Playing

**Problem**: Audio files don't play when clicking on cards.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure your browser allows audio playback (some browsers block autoplay)
- Check that audio files exist in the `public/audio/` directory
- Try clicking the card again (first click may need user interaction)
- Check browser console for error messages

### Images Not Loading

**Problem**: Images don't appear on word cards.

**Solutions**:
- Verify image files exist in `public/images/` directory
- Check that file paths in `src/data/words.json` match actual files
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for 404 errors

### App Not Loading from dist/index.html

**Problem**: Opening `dist/index.html` shows a blank page.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you've run `npm run build` first
- Check that `vite.config.js` has `base: './'` configured
- Try opening in a different browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all files in `dist/` folder are present

### Development Server Issues

**Problem**: `npm run dev` fails or shows errors.

**Solutions**:
- Delete `node_modules/` folder and run `npm install` again
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Ensure Node.js version is 18 or higher: `node --version`
- Check for port conflicts (default port is 5173)

## Generating Real Audio Files

The app currently includes placeholder audio files. To generate real Hindi audio using AWS Polly:

### Quick Start
```bash
# Windows
setup_and_generate_audio.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x setup_and_generate_audio.sh
./setup_and_generate_audio.sh
```

### Manual Generation
1. **Install dependencies**: `pip install boto3`
2. **Configure AWS**: `aws configure` (enter your AWS credentials)
3. **Generate audio**: `python generate_audio_polly.py`
4. **Rebuild app**: `npm run build`

### What You Need
- AWS Account (free tier eligible)
- AWS Access Key & Secret Key
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection

### Cost
Approximately **$0.01** to generate all 94 audio files (essentially free with AWS free tier)

### Documentation
- **Quick Start**: See `AUDIO_QUICK_START.md`
- **Detailed Guide**: See `AUDIO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`

The script generates:
- 42 character pronunciations (vowels + consonants)
- 34 word pronunciations
- 18 phrase pronunciations

All using AWS Polly's neural engine with the Aditi voice (native Hindi speaker).

## Additional Resources

- **Build Verification**: See `BUILD_VERIFICATION.md` for build configuration details
- **Asset Verification**: See `ASSET_VERIFICATION.md` for asset management
- **Assets Guide**: See `ASSETS_README.md` for information about audio and image assets
- **Audio Generation**: See `AUDIO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md` for AWS Polly setup
- **Testing**: See `FINAL_TEST_REPORT.md` for test results

## Support
