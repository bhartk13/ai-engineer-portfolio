This is one of the areas where AI is having a profound and transformative impact. Here are some of the key advancements and trends:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Genomic and Proteomic Analysis:** AI algorithms can rapidly analyze vast amounts of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data to identify novel disease targets (genes or proteins) that are implicated in specific diseases. This is far more efficient than traditional hypothesis-driven research.\n*   **Disease Pathway Mapping:** AI can help map complex biological pathways, revealing how different molecules interact and identifying key nodes that, when modulated, could have a therapeutic effect.\n*   **\"Omics\" Integration:** AI is adept at integrating diverse \"omics\" datasets (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) to build a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and pinpoint the most promising drug targets.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design and Molecule Generation:**\n\n*   **Generative AI Models:** This is a major breakthrough. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), along with transformer-based models, are being used to design entirely new molecules from scratch that have desired properties, such as high binding affinity to a target, good ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) profiles, and synthetic feasibility.\n*   **Property Prediction:** AI models can predict the properties of candidate molecules with high accuracy, saving significant time and resources by avoiding the synthesis and testing of compounds likely to fail.\n*   **\"Scaffold Hopping\":** AI can explore novel chemical structures that are structurally different from known drugs but achieve similar biological effects, potentially leading to new intellectual property and improved drug characteristics.\n\n**3. Improving Preclinical Development:**\n\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI can predict how a drug candidate will behave in preclinical models (cell-based assays, animal studies) and even in early human trials, identifying potential efficacy issues or toxicity concerns earlier in the process.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once initial \"hits\" are found, AI can rapidly optimize their chemical structure to improve potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties, turning a promising compound into a viable drug candidate.\n*   **Designing Better Preclinical Studies:** AI can help design more efficient and informative preclinical experiments by identifying the most relevant models and endpoints.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification and Recruitment:** AI can analyze patient data to identify those most likely to respond to a particular treatment, leading to more targeted and successful clinical trials. It can also help in faster patient recruitment.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of success for clinical trials, allowing companies to allocate resources more effectively.\n*   **Real-World Data (RWD) Analysis:** AI can analyze RWD to gain insights into drug effectiveness and safety in real-world settings, which can inform ongoing trials and post-market surveillance.\n\n**5. Examples of AI in Action:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Famously discovered and advanced a novel drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis from target identification to the clinic in under 18 months, largely due to their AI platform.\n*   **Exscientia:** Has multiple AI-designed drugs in clinical trials across various therapeutic areas, demonstrating the platform's ability to generate diverse and effective molecules.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug design and has partnerships with numerous pharmaceutical companies.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Focuses on using AI and high-throughput screening to map disease biology and discover new therapeutic interventions.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Availability:** The performance of AI models heavily relies on the quality and quantity of training data.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Problem:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction can sometimes be difficult, making it harder for scientists to trust or interpret results.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI-generated insights still require rigorous experimental validation, which remains a bottleneck.\n*   **Regulatory Approval:** Navigating the regulatory landscape for AI-discovered and designed drugs is an evolving process.\n*   **Integration into Existing Workflows:** Seamlessly integrating AI tools into established pharmaceutical R&D processes requires significant organizational and cultural shifts.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just speeding up drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing *how* new medicines are found and developed, making the process more efficient, predictive, and ultimately, more likely to yield life-saving therapies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **\"De Novo Drug Design and Molecule Generation\"**. This is a truly exciting area because it represents a shift from simply screening existing libraries of compounds to actively *creating* entirely new ones with specific, desired characteristics.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what that entails:\n\n**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n\n*   **\"De Novo\"** is Latin for \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\"\n*   In drug discovery, de novo design means using computational methods (especially AI) to design novel molecular structures that have never been synthesized or tested before, but are predicted to interact with a specific biological target and possess favorable drug-like properties.\n\n**How AI Enables De Novo Design:**\n\nThe core of this development lies in the use of **Generative AI Models**. Think of these models as incredibly sophisticated digital artists or architects that can learn the \"grammar\" and \"rules\" of chemistry and biology and then create new compositions.\n\nThe most common types of generative models used include:\n\n1.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**\n    *   **How they work:** GANs consist of two neural networks that compete against each other. One is a **generator**, which tries to create new molecules. The other is a **discriminator**, which tries to distinguish between real molecules (from training data) and the fake molecules created by the generator.\n    *   **The outcome:** Through this adversarial process, the generator gets progressively better at creating molecules that are indistinguishable from real ones, and crucially, can be trained to generate molecules that meet specific criteria.\n\n2.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**\n    *   **How they work:** VAEs learn to compress complex data (like molecular structures) into a lower-dimensional \"latent space\" and then decode it back. This latent space captures the essential characteristics of the molecules. By sampling points from this latent space and decoding them, VAEs can generate new, similar molecules.\n    *   **The advantage:** VAEs are often more stable and easier to control than GANs, allowing for more directed generation of molecules with desired properties.\n\n3.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**\n    *   **How it works:** RL agents are trained to make a sequence of decisions (like adding atoms or bonds) to build a molecule. They receive \"rewards\" based on how well the generated molecule meets predefined criteria (e.g., binding affinity, solubility).\n    *   **The benefit:** RL can be excellent for optimizing molecules step-by-step towards a specific objective.\n\n4.  **Transformer-Based Models (like those used in LLMs):**\n    *   **How they work:** Originally developed for natural language processing, transformers can also be adapted to process molecular sequences (like SMILES strings). They learn the relationships between different parts of a molecule and can generate new sequences that represent novel structures.\n\n**Key AI Capabilities within De Novo Design:**\n\n*   **Learning Chemical Rules:** These models learn the fundamental principles of chemical bonding, valency, and stability from massive datasets of known molecules.\n*   **Predicting Molecular Properties:** Crucially, de novo design isn't just about creating *any* molecule; it's about creating *useful* molecules. AI models are trained to simultaneously predict a wide range of properties:\n    *   **Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule will attach to the target protein.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Ensuring it binds to the intended target and not others (to minimize side effects).\n    *   **ADMET Properties:** Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity – crucial for a drug to be orally bioavailable, reach its target, be cleared from the body, and not be harmful.\n    *   **Synthetic Feasibility:** Can this molecule actually be made in a lab? Some AI models can even predict synthetic pathways.\n*   **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible molecules is astronomical. AI allows researchers to explore this \"chemical space\" much more efficiently, finding promising candidates that might never be discovered through traditional methods.\n\n**Why is this a Game-Changer?**\n\n*   **Unlocking Novelty:** It allows for the discovery of completely new chemical scaffolds, potentially leading to drugs with novel mechanisms of action and overcoming resistance to existing therapies.\n*   **Speed and Efficiency:** Designing molecules computationally is orders of magnitude faster than traditional trial-and-error synthesis and screening.\n*   **Tailored Design:** Researchers can specify desired properties, guiding the AI to generate molecules optimized for multiple criteria simultaneously.\n*   **Intellectual Property:** Designing novel molecules can lead to strong patent protection.\n\nThis development is truly at the forefront of AI in drug discovery, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in creating the medicines of the future.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are heavily involved in de novo drug design, ranging from large pharmaceutical giants to specialized AI-driven biotech startups.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
