## 📅 Course Overview

### **Day 1 – Introduction to Agents**
- Understanding what AI Agents are and how they differ from traditional LLM applications  
- Core concepts: autonomy, tool use, reasoning, and reflection  
- Building a simple agentic workflow  

### **Day 2 – Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- Integrating external tools and APIs into agent workflows  
- Exploring **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for standardizing interactions between models and tools  
- Designing interoperable agent systems  

### **Day 3 – Context Engineering: Sessions & Memory**
- Managing contextual information across sessions  
- Implementing short-term and long-term memory for agents  
- Enhancing reasoning and continuity through memory management  

### **Day 4 – Agent Quality**
- Evaluating agent behavior and performance  
- Conducting structured **evals** and **error analysis**  
- Strategies for improving reliability and alignment  

### *(Day 5 – Advanced Integrations & Capstone Project)*  
- Applying all concepts to build a production-grade multi-agent system  
- End-to-end demonstration and reflection
